*RDS Monitoring*

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a cloud-based relational database to thousands of database requests per second. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages everyday database administration tasks in AWS. 

Six different types of database engines are currently available in RDS: 

Amazon Aurora
MySQL
MariaDB
Microsoft SQL Server
Oracle
PostgreSQL
